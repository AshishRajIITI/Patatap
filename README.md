**Tap-a-Tap** (A clone of Patatap) 
 
 (*)If on laptop-> Just tap any letter of ARSCII value ranging between 097-122 or 065-090, to see the effect.
 (*)If on Mobile-> Just tap anywhere on your screen to see the animation-sound synchrony. I have randomised the click using a function so that every time you click on mobile, you                    see a different effect!
 
 **NOTE** => Presently, it only has two shapes(circle and rectangle).
 
 **FUTURE SCOPE** => Build a chrome extension which includes this functionality as subpart. Also, add a record functionality. 

What is Patatap?
Patatap is a portable animation and sound kit. With the touch of a finger create melodies charged with moving shapes.

This application is built using vanilla Javascript, Paper.js(an open source vector graphics scripting framework that runs on top of the HTML5 Canvas)  , Howler.js(an audio library for the modern web.)

This project helped me to learn about adding different library feature into our project and use its power to build with ease.

It also made me learn on how to effectively use documentation's example.
